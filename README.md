GitFinder Web App
Welcome to the GitFinder Web App! This application allows users to find GitHub profiles by entering a username. Once a user is found, you can view their profile information and a list of up to 30 repositories they own.

Getting Started
To use the GitFinder Web App, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/hankchang-in/GitFinder.git
Open the project in your preferred code editor.

Run the application locally. You can use a simple server or an integrated development environment (IDE) with a built-in server.

Usage
Open the application in your web browser.

Enter the GitHub username you want to search for in the provided input field.

Click the "Search" button.

View the user's profile information, including their avatar, name, bio, and location.

Scroll down to see a list of up to 30 repositories owned by the user.

API Limitation
Please note that the GitHub API limits the number of repositories returned to 30. If a user has more than 30 repositories, only the first 30 will be displayed.

Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

Implement pagination to allow users to view more than 30 repositories.
Add error handling for cases where the GitHub username entered does not exist.
Enhance the user interface for a more polished look.
